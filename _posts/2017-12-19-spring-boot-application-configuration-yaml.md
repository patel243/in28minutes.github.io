## What is YAML?

YAML is a human readable serialization language

> YAML stands for Yet Another Markup Language

Let's consider an example

application.properties
```
level1.property1 = 5
level1.property2 = 6
level1.property3 = 7
level1.level2.property4 = 8
level1.level2.property5 = 10
level1.level2.property6 = 11
```
Above property file is cool but it is not very readable.

Let's consider the same example in YAML format:
application.yaml
```
level1:
  property1: 5
  property2: 6
  property3: 7
  level2:
     property4: 8
     property5: 10
     property6: 11
```

YAML 
- is concise
- is more readable

## Spring Boot and YAML

Spring Boot has excellent support for YAML configuration. 

### Example 1

application.properties
```
server.port = 9080
```

application.yaml
```
server:
	port: 9080
```

### Example 2

application.properties
```
app.name=in28Minutes
app.description=${app.name} is your first Spring Boot application
welcome.message=Welcome message from property file! Welcome to ${app.name}
```

application.yaml
```
app:
   name: In28Minutes
   description: ${app.name} is your first Spring Boot application
welcome:
    message: Welcome to your first Spring Boot app!
```

### Example 3 - Dynamic Configuration

application.properties
```
basic.value: true
basic.message: Dynamic Message
basic.number: 100
```

application.yaml
```
basic: 
   value: true
   message: Dynamic Message YAML
   number: 100
```
