### REST vs SOAP

REST vs SOAP are not really comparable. REST is an architectural style. SOAP is a message exchange format.

Letâ€™s compare the popular implementations of REST and SOAP styles.

- RESTful Sample Implementation : JSON over HTTP
- SOAP Sample Implementation : XML over SOAP over HTTP

At a high level, SOAP is about restrictions on your message structures while REST is an architectural approach focused on using HTTP Transport.
- SOAP is particular about the **Data Exchange Format**. With SOAP, this is always SOAP-XML, which is an XML with envelope, header and body. Both the request and response should adhere to the SOAP structure.
- REST is very particular about using HTTP as the transport protocol. It intends to make the best use of the features provided by HTTP - Request methods, Request headers, Response, Response headers etc.

### Message interchange format
- With SOAP, you use SOAP XML format for Request and Response
- With REST, there is no such fixed format. You could exchange messages based on XML, JSON or any other convenient format. JSON is the most popular among the used formats.

### Service Definitions
- SOAP makes use of **Web Service Definition Language (WSDL)**. 
- REST does not have a standard service definition language. Even though WADL was one of the first standards to be proposed, it is not very popular. Swagger or Open API is another popular approach.


### Transport
- SOAP does not place any restrictions on the kind of transport protocol. You could either use Web (which is HTTP), or MQ. 
- REST intends to make the best use of HTTP Transport Protocol

### Ease of Implementation
RESTFful services are typically a lot easier to implement than SOAP based web services. 
* REST typically uses JSON, which is easier to parse and process. In addition to that, REST does not require you to have a service definition in place to provide a web service. 
* However with SOAP, you are needed to define your service using WSDL, and greater overhead is involved in processing and parsing the SOAP-XML messages.
