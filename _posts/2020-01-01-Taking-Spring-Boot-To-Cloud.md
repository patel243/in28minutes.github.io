## Introduction

You want to learn about the cloud. But you don't know where to start. 

One of the best option to learn the cloud is to deploy some of the applications that you have developed to different cloud providers.

When we talk about the Java Spring Boot world, typically we talk about
- Web Applications
- REST APIs
- Microservices
- Full Stack Applications

How about deploying these applications to different cloud platforms?

That's the kind of courses that we would be talking about in the article.

## Introduction to Cloud

Let's start with understanding why we need the cloud.

### Why do we need the cloud?

The three reasons are
- On Demand Resource Provisioning
- Avoid "Undifferentiated Heavy Lifting"
- Improved Latency and Availability

#### On Demand Resource Provisioning

If you are amazon or a startup, the load on your application varies a lot during the year. Load during peak season like holidays might 2-10 times the regular load. If you provision infrastructure in your data center for peak load, then what would it be doing during the rest of year? Sitting Idle!

That's the problem cloud solves!

You can provision and release resources on demand.

#### Avoid "Undifferentiated Heavy Lifting"

What is the focus of a business? 

To create amazing solutions and provide great service to their customers. 

If business focus on automation, tools and infrastructure, the focus shifts from their core job. 

Why not leave the "Undifferentiated Heavy Lifting" to the cloud providers?

#### Improved Latency and Availability

Each of the cloud providers have multiple data centers available in multiple continents and multiple countries.

It would be difficult for businesses to set up such wide spread infrastructure. 

However, to have high availability and low latency for end users, you would need to have multiple deployments around the world.

Cloud Providers make it easy for you to have multiple deployments of your application across the world.


### IAAS vs PAAS

Now, you want to go the cloud. You have an important choice to make.

Do you want to deploy your applications the same way you deploying while using your data center or do you want to use facilities provided by your cloud provider?

For example, if you are using AWS (Amazon Web Services), you have two options
- Approach 1 - You can create virtual servers (EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud) and deploy your applications to the virtual servers.
- Approach 2 - You can use a service provided by AWS - for example, AWS Elastic Beanstalk - to deploy your application and not worry about the virtual servers.

Approach 1 is typically called IAAS - Infrastructure as a Service. You are getting the infrastructure from the cloud provider and deploying the applications the usual way you do. The cloud provider is responsible only for providing the virtual servers. You are responsible for installing OS, OS Upgrades, Installing Runtime, Runtime upgrades and everything that goes along with them.

Different clouds provide different IAAS Services. The virtual servers are also called differently in different clouds
- AWS calls them EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- Azure Virtual Machines
- Google Compute Engines

Approach 2 is called PAAS - Platform as a Service. You are only responsible for your application deployable unit. The cloud provider is responsible for Platform Upgrades, Runtime Upgrades and OS Upgrades.

PAAS Examples are Managed Services provided by different cloud providers. A good examples are the database management services provided.
- AWS provides RDS - Relational Database Service
- Azure provides DB for MySQL

Great thing about these managed services is that the cloud provider would take care of most non functional requirements.
- Reliability
- Availability
- Backups

### Platform as a Service in Depth

If we look at PAAS in depth, there are a number of application PAAS services offered by different cloud providers
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Google App Engine
- Azure Web Apps

These services make it easy to deploy Java applications, Containers and a wide variety of applications to the cloud.

These PAAS offering come with Support for
- Multiple Environments
- Multiple Platforms and Language Support
- Container and Multi Container Support
- Deployment Strategies - Blue Green Deployment
- Auto Scaling
- Load Balancing
- CI/CD (AWS Code Pipeline, AWS Code Build, Azure DevOps, Google Cloud Build)


#### Cloud Specific Container Orchestration Solutions

One of the important developments of the last few years is the evolution of containers as a platform neutral, language neutral deployment options.

Cloud providers provide PAAS options around containers and container orchestration. The most important offerings are
- AWS Fargate or ECS (Elastic Container Service)
- Azure Container Instance - Azure is actually moving towards AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)


#### Cloud Neutral Kubernetes Based Container Orchestration Solutions

Other important evolution of last few years is the evolution of Kubernetes as the Cloud Neutral Container Orchestration Service.

Each of the cloud providers provide Container Orchestration Solution around Kubernetes.
- GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)
- AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)
- EKS (AWS Container Services for Kubernetes)
