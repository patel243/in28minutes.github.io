# Design pattern in Microservices

Greetings from [in28minutes.com](https://courses.in28minutes.com/). In this read, we will take a look at some of the interesting *decomposition design patterns* in a microservices architecture.

## Decomposition Design patterns

In the real microservices world, the decomposition design pattern (i.e. Breaking down of an application into small independent microservices) is based on the following capabilities such as -

 - Decomposition by business capability
 - Decomposition by subdomain
 - Decomposition by transactions
 - Strangler or the Vine pattern
 - Bulkhead pattern

The main objective of this design pattern is to - 

 - Achieve independent team and services
 - Avoid distributed monolithic architecture
 - Avoid cascading failures of the whole application
 - Simplify the business logic complexity

Now let us go ahead and understand the important ones.

### Decomposition by business capability pattern

 - This is ideally the simplest of all patterns available under the decomposition design pattern umbrella were in the architects -
	 - Identify the business capabilities
	 - Define the services for that business capabilities

### Decomposition by subdomain pattern

 - It a design patterns that follow the domain-driven approach wherein the independent microservice will be loosed coupled and less cohesive
 - This pattern works in four steps i.e. -
	 - *Analyze the domain* - Select a particular area or the component  or a problem which is to be addressed with the software improvement
	 - *Identify subdomain* - Break download the particular item into smaller parts to identify the problems that require a software solution consideration
	 - *Define the bounded contexts* - Bounded context means defining the boundary of a certain business capability. This step helps to identify the domain models and properties needed in each model. Remember this step helps to define the **Domain Model pattern** and **Aggregate pattern**
	 - *Design microservices* - Each bounded context defined in Step3 related to an independent microservice that depends on a business context. Each microservice should not overlap with different bounded contexts

### Strangler design pattern

 - The **Strangler** design pattern is one of those design patterns that let you easily break a monolithic application into smaller independent microservices
 - Offers incremental breakdown of the monolithic application by replacing the particular component with an independent microservice
 - Helps to follow the test-driven development with the highest degree of coding quality, business logic, and sonar results
 - Follow the Transform, Co-exist and Eliminate approach where
	 - *Transform* means developing a new independent component
	 - *Co-exists* means both new and old component working in parallel
	 - *Eliminate* means discarding the old component and bring in the new component
 - Selection of monolithic component for refractor -
	 - Select the simplest component if you're a newbie or,
	 - Select the component that has good coverage and less technical debt on sonar or,
	 - Select the component which is best suitable for cloud infrastructure and have scalability requirements or,
	 - Select the component that has minimal business impact and requires frequent deployment

### Bulkhead design pattern

 - The Bulkhead design pattern is one of those design patterns that help design applications that are tolerant of failure
 - In this architecture, application elements are isolated into pools so that if one element fails, the others will continue to function
 - This pattern helps to resolve quality issues like -
	 - Failure propagation as the elements are isolated and does not share the resources (like storage, synchronous service-to-service calls, hardware, etc.)
	 - Noisy neighbors wherein the abnormal utilization of resources by one element does not affect the other elements of the bulkhead design pattern
	 - Unusual demands from elements experiencing unpredicted demand
 - Offers advantages like -
	 - Isolation of consumer and services from the cascading failures
	 - Allows to preserve some functionality in the event of an element failure while other elements continue to work properly
	 - Allows to deploy services that offer a different quality of service for consuming application
